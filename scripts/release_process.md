- update version in version.txt (following semver)
- run update_stuff.py from the scripts folder
- regenerate test output by running cmake with -DDOCTEST_TEST_MODE=COLLECT and then running ctest
- run update_changelog.py to update the changelog based on the closed issues & PRs
    - might need credentials/access tokens
    - might need a tmp folder in the root drive (C or D) if on Windows
- commit in dev
- rebase dev onto master
- push all branches (git push --all)
- create github release with the same semver tag as the changelog
    - copy the text from a previous release and update the version numbers & dates
- OPTIONAL: update packages (I've never done it)
